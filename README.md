## Set-up

1. Create a repository by using the [Use this template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) green button. 
    - Use the Owner drop-down to select your GitHub account.
    - Type a name for the repo
    - Set visibility to private
    - Leave other options unselected
    - Select create repository from template
2. Clone the repository in your IDE
3. _Create_ and _activate_ a venv e.g. `python3 -m venv venv` then `source venv/bin/activate` (Mac)
   or `.\env\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
4. Install the libraries from requirements.txt e.g. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

PyCharm and VS Code provide built in support for CSS and HTML.

An online editor e.g., [Codepen](https://codepen.io) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net), may be more
convenient to quickly write and see HTML and CSS combined.
